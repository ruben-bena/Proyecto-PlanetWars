## Brief Introduction
The objective of this project is to create a game that resembles the game **OGame**.

Playing the game our team has produced, you will be able to manage your own planet and fleet, which you have to use to defend yourself from enemy planets that want to invade you and take your resources.

Your fleet and defenses will be made of:
- Light Hunters
- Heavy Hunters
- Battle Ships
- Armored Ships
- Missile Launchers
- Ion Cannons
- Plasma Cannons

Their cost is set according to their stats. **Manage your resources wisely!**

The GUI is meant to be as interactive as possible, you can upgrade, build, invade, get invaded, check previous battles, and much more. All without having to look at a terminal!

#### Database
This game also has connection to an online database, so don't worry about losing your progress once you close the program. **You will be able to load any last sessions you've played!**
But that's not only what our database is for, every battle's information and result is carefully saved into it, which you will be able to access from the webpage in this project.

## How to install
